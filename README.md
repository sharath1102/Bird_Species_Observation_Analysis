# Bird Species Observation Analysis

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis comparing bird species observations across forest and grassland habitats, with a focus on temporal, spatial, and environmental patterns. The project includes data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization using Power BI, and actionable insights for conservation, land management, eco-tourism, and policy support.

## Step-by-Step Analytical Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Gathered bird observation data from field studies, capturing: habitat type, species, location, plot, season, time/day, environmental factors (temperature, humidity, weather), disturbance, observer information, and conservation status.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized raw data, handled missing values, and generated metrics like unique species counts and aggregates for various dimensions (plot, habitat, season).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored trends in observation frequency, species richness, habitat and plot comparisons, and time-of-day/seasonal patterns.

### 4. Visualization: Power BI Dashboard
- Dashboard (`Bird_Observation_Analysis-Power-Bi.pdf`) contains:
  - Overview metrics (total observations, species count, diversity)
  - Forest vs. grassland comparisons
  - Temporal trends (season/month/day/hour)
  - Spatial analysis by plot and location
  - Species and conservation status breakdown
  - Environmental and disturbance factors

### 5. Insight Generation
- Key insights include:
  - Grasslands show higher species diversity; conservation efforts should prioritize these areas.
  - Certain plots and seasons are hotspots for birdwatching and research.
  - Unique and shared species across habitats identified for targeted interventions.
  - Watchlist and stewardship species highlighted for policy action.

### 6. Report and Recommendations
- `Insights.pdf` provides actionable guidance for:
  - Conservation prioritization
  - Plot and habitat management
  - Eco-tourism strategies
  - Agricultural sustainability
  - Policy and biodiversity monitoring
